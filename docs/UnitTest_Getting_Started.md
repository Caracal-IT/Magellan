Use Visual Studio to define and run unit tests to maintain code health, ensure code coverage, and find errors and faults before your customers do. 
Run your unit tests frequently to make sure your code is working properly.

In this article, the code uses C#, illustrations are in C#, but the concepts and features apply to .NET languages, C++, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
